- focuses on running and monitoring systems and continually  improving processes and procedures
- automating changes responding to events
- Design Principles :-
	- **Perform Operations as Code** :-
		- apply the same engineering discipline that you use for application code to your entire environment.
		- define and update entire workload as code
		- script operations procedures
		- automate executions
		
	- **Frequent small reversible Changes** :-
		- design workloads to allow components to be updated regularly
		- make changes in small increments that can be reversed if they fail to aid in the identification
	- **Refine operations procedures frequently** 
	- Anticipate Failure :-
		- preliminary exercises to identify potential sources
		- test failure scenarios
		- set up regular game days to  test workload and responses to simulated events
	- Learn from operational failures
