- i heard once that Thomas edison to think about something use to drowse while thinking about it. he held a heavy bunch of keys in his hand..so when ever his fist loosened from sleep , the keys would fall to ground,  waking him up. 
- this status of drowsy mind is actually free-er than concious thinkning so it can attach more strings together.
- Today i got firsthand proof of that it works
- i was looking into what it means as rawResp field while testing an API in postman...i have been trying to find it since morning..
- but by like noon 12:30 i was drowsy..in that drowsyness i figured out rawresp is Raw Response. Which is probably something that was responded to me when i used the last api
- and that was correct...rest of the api tested smooth like butter
