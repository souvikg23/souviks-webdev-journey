  APP fault from my end:
  1) continue as guest button not working.
  2) even after signing up with mobile, the explore button redirects to log in. then the login screen asks for mobile , then otp. after logging in like that the explore  button still redirects to login and cycle continues
  3) The google login works correctly. but  after google login again the explore button sends to login page
  4) menu button ( top right) is not working
